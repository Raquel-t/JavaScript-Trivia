## Challenges
I've familiarized myself with HTML and experimented with CSS, however this challenge was focused on JavaScript fundamentals and even if I got the scope of it down. This assignment proved to be a challenge. I utilized my available resources and tweaked my code multiple times; which helped to start the time but once additional functions were added, the code crashed. I will work on this assignment on my downtime and will push all changes to GitHub once complete.
